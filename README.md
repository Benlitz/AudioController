# AudioController

**AudioController** is a tool that allows you to switch between the different audio output/input sources available on your system using a keyboard hot-key.

The purpose is to switch quickly between your audio devices, without having to open this menu:

It displays a notification message on screen and play a sound (through the new device) when switching the default audio device

## Features

 - The hot-key is **Windows+O** by default but it can be changed.
 - Audio devices can be ignored and can be renamed.
 - The visual appearance (color, size, opacity) and the duration of the notification can be customized.
 - The duration of the notification can be customized.
 - The display on which the notification appears can be customized (either a fixed display, or the display where the mouse cursor is).
 - The notification can be disabled when there's a full-screen application running on the target display.
 - It is possible to choose whether to play a sound on the new selected audio device when using the hot-key.
