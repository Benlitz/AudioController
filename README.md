# AudioController

**NOTE: This tool is under development and the current release has not been much tested yet.**

**AudioController** is a tool that allows you to switch between the different audio output/input sources available on your system using a keyboard hot-key.

The hot-key is currently set to **Windows+O**. It will be customizable in the future.

The purpose is to switch quickly between your audio devices, without having to open this menu:
